# Hi!

I am a quantitative ecologist, with expertise in:

-   [**urban biodiversity, ecology and evolution**](urban-ecology.qmd)\
-   [**dispersal ecology**](dispersal.qmd), and behavioural ecology more generally

I work using a mix of data science tools, lab experiments, field surveys and the occasional simulation.

Most of my work is on [land snails](snails.qmd) 🐌, but I am or have been involved in projects studying plants 🍀, [spiders](spiders.qmd) 🕸️🕷️, mites, insects 🪰... and snail parasites.

I am currently working on dune ecology-related questions ([DuneFront project](https://dunefront.eu/)), in the [Terrestrial Ecology Unit](https://www.ecology.ugent.be/terec/) \@ Ghent University, in Belgium.
