<h1>Research axis 1: Dispersal ecology and evolution</h1>
	<p style="text-align:justify">Dispersal, i.e. movement leading to gene flow in space, is a key life-history trait with important consequences for the dynamics and evolution of populations, especially in changing environments.
As costs and benefits of dispersal vary between individuals and depending on environmental context, condition- and context-dependent dispersal rules are expected to evolve and have been described in numerous taxa. However, our understanding of condition- and context-dependent dispersal is complicated by the fact that a given causal factor may have different effects at each stage of dispersal, and interact with others in synergistic or contradictory ways.
I develop lab- and field-based experiments to understand how the interaction of various selective pressures shape the evolution of dispersal strategies and the association of dispersal with other traits in syndromes. I am also interested in unraveling the ecological and evolutionary consequences of such syndromes, especially in the context of human-induced rapid environmental changes (HIREC, see also Research axis #2)</p>
