title: "Land snails"

Land molluscs are my main group of expertise. I use them to understand the impacts of urbanization, as models in dispersal ecology, and to study the causes and consequences of individual behaviour differences (or "personalities").

I work mostly with the common land snails [*Cornu aspersum*](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/480298) and [*Cepaea nemoralis*](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/48586), but have handled 20 other species of land molluscs in the lab.
