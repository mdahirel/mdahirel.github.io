<h1>Research axis 1: Dispersal ecology and evolution</h1>

	<p style="text-align:justify">Dispersal, i.e. movement leading to gene flow in space, is a key life-history trait with important consequences for the dynamics and evolution of populations, especially in changing environments.</p>

	<p style="text-align:justify">As costs and benefits of dispersal vary between individuals and depending on environmental context, condition- and context-dependent dispersal rules are expected to evolve and have been described in numerous taxa. However, our understanding of condition- and context-dependent dispersal is complicated by the fact that a given causal factor may have different effects at each stage of dispersal, and interact with others in synergistic or contradictory ways.</p>
		
	<p style="text-align:justify">I develop lab- and field-based experiments to understand how the interaction of various selective pressures shape the evolution of dispersal strategies and the association of dispersal with other traits in syndromes. I am also interested in unraveling the ecological and evolutionary consequences of such syndromes, especially in the context of human-induced rapid environmental changes (HIREC, see also <a href="https://mdahirel.github.io/urbanecology"> Research axis #2</a>)</p>
