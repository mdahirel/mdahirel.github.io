title: Research axis 1 - Dispersal ecology and evolution

! (/images/snail_dispersal.JPG)

Dispersal (i.e. movements leading to gene flow) is one of the four fundamental mechanisms shaping evolution and genetic diversity (along with selection, drift and mutation) and one of three fundamental drivers of population dynamics (along with reproduction and mortality). In the current context of widespread human-induced environmental changes, understanding dispersal is thus crucial to understand how/whether organisms will be able to cope, especially as many of these environmental changes are intrinsically spatial in nature (such as habitat fragmentation).

I develop lab- and field-based experiments to understand how the interaction of various selective pressures shape the evolution of dispersal strategies and the association of dispersal with other traits in syndromes. I am also interested in unraveling the ecological and evolutionary consequences of such syndromes, especially in the context of human-induced rapid environmental changes (HIREC, see also <a href="https://mdahirel.github.io/urbanecology"> Research axis #2</a>)
