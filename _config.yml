subtitle: Behavioural and Evolutionary Ecology
description: I am a behavioural and evolutionary ecologist interested in the causes and consequences of individual-, population- and species-level variation in behaviour, morphology and life-history. My research is especially focused on dispersal, as a key trait bridging ecological and evolutionary dynamics, and on the role of behaviour in explaining speciesâ€™ ability (or inability) to persist in cities.
