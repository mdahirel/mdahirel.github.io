# Hello!

I am a behavioural and evolutionary ecologist, mainly interested in the causes and consequences of individual-, population- and species-level variation in behaviour, morphology and life-history, how it varies across space and time and how it is shaped by environmental conditions.
My research is especially focused on the role of behaviour in explaining speciesâ€™ ability (or inability) to persist in increasingly anthropogenic environments. 
I develop these research themes using a combination of lab-based experiments and monitoring in naturalistic contexts.

I use terrestrial gastropods (mainly the land snail *Cornu aspersum*), spider mites (*Tetranychus urticae*) and spiders as model organisms.
