# Hi!

I am a behavioural and evolutionary ecologist interested in the causes and consequences of dispersal and in adaptation to city life.

I am currently a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellow in the Terrestrial Ecology Unit \@ Ghent University, in Belgium (project [HELICITY](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101022802)).
