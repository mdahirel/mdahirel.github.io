<h1>Research axis 2: Behavioural and evolutionary responses to urbanisation</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Due to the continued spatial expansion of anthropogenic environments and the intensity of human activities, the habitats of countless species and populations are now altered, destroyed or fragmented to a degree, leading to the decline or extinction of numerous taxa. Nevertheless, certain species manage to successfully exploit these evolutionarily novel conditions and are able to persist and even expand in anthropogenic environments; determining what are the characteristics that make some species or genotypes ‘winners’ and others ‘losers’ in the face of given environmental changes is a continuing task in ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Urbanisation is one of the most dramatic forms of human-induced rapid environmental changes (HIREC), and a better understanding of organisms’ adaptive or maladaptive responses may help mitigate its impacts. In addition, their standardized nature make cities great ‘natural experiments’ to study the consequences of multiple environmental changes on behaviours, and provide interesting opportunities for testing general ecological and evolutionary hypotheses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> Using sites in France and Belgium, I investigate how various behaviours (<a href="https://mdahirel.github.io/dispersal">dispersal</a>, foraging behaviour; reproductive behaviour…) and life-history traits respond to urbanisation at various scales, and evaluate the consequences for population/ species persistence and interactions.</p>
