Besides snails, I occasionally study spiders:

-   orb weavers (primarily Araneidae), as the morphology of their webs can contain information about their foraging strategies, especially in response to environmental changes.

-   money spiders (Linyphiidae, especially *Erigone* sp.) as models to study the evolution of dispersal and integrated phenotypes.
