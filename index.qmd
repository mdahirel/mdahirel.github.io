# Hi!

I am an evolutionary ecologist interested in:

-  [**urban ecology and evolution**](urban-ecology.qmd): How organisms manage to persist in cities (or not)? How much do they have to change to do so? Can we predict it? What is the role of urban history and planning?  
- [**animal dispersal**](dispersal.qmd), i.e. animals moving to reproduce away from their birth or previous reproduction sites: How, which individuals, why?

I use lab experiments, field surveys, data science tools and the occasional simulation to answer these questions.

I generally study [land snails](snails.qmd) 🐌, but I've been involved in projects studying [spiders](spiders.qmd) 🕸️🕷️, mites, insects 🐞, plants 🍀... and snail parasites.

I am currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow in the [Terrestrial Ecology Unit](https://www.ecology.ugent.be/terec/) \@ Ghent University, in Belgium (project [HELICITY](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101022802)).
