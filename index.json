Knowledge of dispersal is crucial to understand how/whether organisms will be able to cope, with current environmental changes, which are often spatially structured (such as habitat fragmentation).\nI develop lab- and field-based experiments to understand how the interaction of various selective pressures shape the evolution of dispersal strategies and the association of dispersal with other traits in syndromes. I am also interested in unraveling the ecological and evolutionary consequences of such syndromes, especially in the context of human-induced rapid environmental changes and range expansions.\nMain collaborations: Armelle Ansart, Julien Pétillon, David Renault (University of Rennes 1), Solène Croci (CNRS, Rennes), Dries Bonte (Ghent University), Elodie Vercken (INRA, Sophia-Antipolis)\nCollaboration networks: Member of the dispNet research network\n","date":1589414400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589414400,"objectID":"ee167441c65659b24b403106cd86c1c5","permalink":"/project/dispersal/","publishdate":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dispersal/","section":"project","summary":"Who moves?

The real world lies outside the urban realm, in forests, dales, and fields. Where the wild things are.\nBut if I am honest I must admit I secretly like cities.\"\nMenno Schilthuizen, Darwin comes to town, Quercus, 2018\n\rOver half of humanity now lives in cities, and this proportion, along with the surface of urban lands, is expected to rise continuously during this century. Urbanization is one of the most dramatic and complex land use changes caused by humans, combining at various scales habitat fragmentation and loss, increased temperatures as well as light, noise and chemical pollution.\nMany species are unable to adapt: urbanization has caused numerous population declines and local species extinctions, and is a major source of biological homogenization worldwide. This is likely in turn to influence human well-being and health, through the loss or degradation of key ecosystem services in cities. Yet, some organisms persist or even thrive in cities, directly or following evolutionary changes.\nUsing cities in France and Belgium, I investigate how various behaviours and life-history traits respond to urbanisation at various scales, and try to find out whether this affects population/ species persistence in cities and interactions with other species, including humans.\nMain collaborations: Dries Bonte (Ghent University), Solène Croci (CNRS, Rennes)\nCollaboration networks: Participant to the SPEEDY project; member of the Global Urban Evolution consortium (GLUE)\nI also contribute to the Life in the City: Urban Evolution blog (edited by Elizabeth Carlen, Lindsay Miles \u0026amp; Kristin Winchell)\n","date":1589414400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589414400,"objectID":"42202b1a256d8ca1824a2e9a12c03a6a","permalink":"/project/urban-ecology/","publishdate":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/urban-ecology/","section":"project","summary":"Living in the grey forest","tags":[],"title":"Urban ecology","type":"project"}]
