# Hi!

I am an evolutionary ecologist, with expertise in:

-   [**urban biodiversity, ecology and evolution**](urban-ecology.qmd)\
-   **behavioural ecology**, especially animal movement and [dispersal](dispersal.qmd)

I work using a mix of (in no particular order) lab experiments, field surveys, data science tools and the occasional simulation.

I generally study [land snails](snails.qmd) 🐌, but I've been involved in projects studying [spiders](spiders.qmd) 🕸️🕷️, mites, insects 🪰, plants 🍀... and snail parasites.

Until recently I was a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow in the [Terrestrial Ecology Unit](https://www.ecology.ugent.be/terec/) \@ Ghent University, in Belgium (project [HELICITY](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101022802)), and I am currently looking for my next job.
