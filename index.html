	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<p>I am a behavioural and evolutionary ecologist, mainly interested in the causes and consequences of individual-, population- and species-level variation in behaviour, morphology and life-history, how it varies across space and time and how it is shaped by environmental conditions. My research is especially focused on the role of behaviour in explaining speciesâ€™ ability (or inability) to persist in increasingly anthropogenic environments. 
        I develop these research themes using a combination of lab-based experiments and monitoring in naturalistic contexts.</p>
